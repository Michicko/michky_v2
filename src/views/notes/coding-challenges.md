## Intro

Coding challenges - It’s a challenge i’m going to take starting today (November 27th 2024).

These are challenges that I’ve used or am using as exercises to learn a new programming language, technology and improve my programming skills.

Most of the challenges will be based on real world tools and utilities.

These [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro/) are picked to be small enough to be completed in my spare time over a week or two and yet large enough to be complete working projects.<br/><br/>

**Note**: *Scroll down to see the projects I’ve built so far*.

Thanks to the themes I develop every now and then people who have bought them contact me to ask me if I can work on some of their projects either designing and developing a custom theme or developing other projects, unfortunately most of the time it is not possible for me because I don't have much free time at the moment as I have a full time job. <br />

However a few months ago I received a message from Rie where he invited me to work on a new project that I found interesting as it was not too big and where I would also have the opportunity to use Astro as a framework to create the project's website.
